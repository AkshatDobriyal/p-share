DESCRIPTION
• An Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application for image publishing and sharing via IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and awarding/tipping Ethers to the image owner for a particular image.

• Developed Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity for storing images and having functionalities to upload images on IPFS and applauding the image by tipping the image owner with some Ethers.

• Created tests for the smart contract using the Mocha test framework and Chai library.

• Deployed the smart contract on the Ropsten test network via MetaMask.

 • Developed a front-end application using React library to show the images posted on IPFS and having a user interface to access all the functionalities of the smart contract.

• Used web3.js to connect and interact with the Ethereum node in the front-end React application and access all the functionalities and states of the Ethereum smart contract.

STEPS TO RUN THE DAPP
1) Add the MetaMask extension from the chrome web store to your web browser.

2) Sign up/Sign in to your Ethereum account via MetaMask and select the Ropsten Test Network.

3) Add some free test Ether to your account from Ropsten Ethereum Faucet through the link:- https://faucet.ropsten.be/

4) Now, use the link to the deployed dApp provided above to open and view the dApp on your browser and access its features.
